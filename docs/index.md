# Use `#` for the biggest headline

## Use `##` for a smaller, `###` and so on

One paragraph

Blank lines give you another paragraph

Use `*` to make something *italicized*

Use `**` to make something **bold**

Use backticks to quote `some text`

Use triple backticks to block quote

```
Like this, it can be used to deal with
multi-line quotes
```
Use `[text on screen](url)` for links, [like this](https://google.com)

Use `![alt text](url)` for images, ![Empress Faustina](https://usf-portal.github.io/severan-database-project/images/sample.jpg)

The horizontal rule (above & below) is a nice way to break up pages into different sections

---

* This is an unordered list
* Each item is bulleted
	* Indenting makes for sub-items
* So indent like you want it to appear visually

1. This is an ordered list
2. It works much like the unordered list
	1. You can make sub items
	3. And even if you screw up the numbers it will correct them
	
You can even do tables like this...

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ------------
First Cell | Second Cell | Third Cell
Fourth Cell | Fifth Cell | Sixth Cell
